For this assignment, you will be exploring musical play and experimentation, by creating a virtual musical instrument using Godot. 

This will be holographic controls where you press buttons, move sliders, dance around and it makes different sounds: 

Your project should demonstrate:

- At least one scene with a nice a holographic unterface for making sound
- Some interactivity with buttons connected up to some code that make sounds

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Complexity | 33% | Use of lots of systems in Godot such as custom materials, animations and interactions. A lot of new nodes created. Complex UI interaction such as a sequencer or synthesiser. UI created procedurally from files. Lots of variety in the sounds created. A live performance Use of controllers or external input. The instrument is "programmable". Sound is generated procedurally. Excellent visual feedback | Simple UI based on clicking buttons to make sounds. Use of loops and at least one array. Use of timers. UI is generated in editor.  No external input. Good variety of sounds. Based on a real instrument | A basic soundboard with buttons to make sounds | Forked the repo, made some commits, not much working, but it makes a sound | Failed to fork the repo, no commits made |
| Aesthetic | 33% | Novel user interface for creating live sound. Complex button and knob arrangement. High quality of visual design. Original, high quality assets produced. Original  recorded audio. Visually coherent and easy to use. Great variety of musical expressiveness. Sounds are interesting and coherent. Crazy and beautiful and lots of novelty | Straightforward, intuitive interface with a reasonable amount of control of a good range of sound. Ability to perform live with a good degree of expression. Some simple assets created. | Basic interface with one screen. Some assets made and some acquired from online sources. Not too much variety in the expressiveness of the instrument | Simple or unintuitive user interface. User interface made from premade assets. Sound are premade or made using simple tools | Basic user interface that makes sound, without any expressiveness or novelty or much fun. | Project doesnt make any sound
| Documentation | 33% | Large number of commits. Good quality video demo and good documentation, with all sections completed. Commits evenly spaced throughout the project | Smaller number of commits over a shorter period of time, but a good bit of work evident in the latter weeks of the project. Video and documentation completed to high standard | All done in week or two before the delivery date. Lots of commits in last two weeks. Documentation incomplete or video incomplete. | All done in the final week. Incomplete documentation or video. Few commits | No use of git. project doesnt work |
